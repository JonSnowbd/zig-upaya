# Upaya
> upaya: a means that goes or brings one up to some goal; skillful means

Zig-based framework for creating game tools and helper apps. Consists of the following:
- *Sokol*: used for cross-platform rendering
- *STB Image*: image loader
- *Tiny Filebrowser*: cross-platform filebrowsers and dialogs
- *Dear ImGui*: needs no introduction

Upaya provides a set of conveniences to speed up tool building:
- *fs*: one-liners for saving/loading JSON and binary files
- *mem*: C allocator and a temp allocator (just use and never free)
- *menu*: helpers for managing a main menu bar
- *colors*: ImGui color translations and helpers
